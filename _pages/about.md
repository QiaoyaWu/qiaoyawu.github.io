Hi, I am Qiaoya Wu (吴巧雅), a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
I work with [Prof. Yue Shen](http://quasar.astro.illinois.edu/index.html#) on multi-wavelength observations on active galactic nuclei (AGNs/quasars), quasar spectral surveys, and photoionization models. I am also interested in black hole binaries and cosmological large-scale structure.
Outside of research, I enjoy playing badminton, board games, and spending time with my beloved cat [Nova](https://www.instagram.com/nova_q.w/).
