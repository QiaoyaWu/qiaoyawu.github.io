Hi, I’m Qiaoya Wu (吴巧雅, "Woo, Chow-Yah"), a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, working with [Prof. Yue Shen](http://quasar.astro.illinois.edu/index.html#). My research focuses on **active galactic nuclei (AGNs)** and **quasars**, especially their multi-wavelength observations, spectral surveys, and photoionization models. I am passionate about understanding the vicinity of supermassive black holes and their statistical properties across redshift.
