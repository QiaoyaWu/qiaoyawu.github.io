Hi, I‚Äôm Qiaoya Wu (Âê¥Â∑ßÈõÖ, "Woo, Chow-Yah"), a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, working with [Prof. Yue Shen](http://quasar.astro.illinois.edu/index.html#). My research focuses on **active galactic nuclei (AGNs)** and **quasars**, especially their multi-wavelength observations, spectral surveys, and photoionization models. I am passionate about understanding the vicinity of supermassive black holes and their statistical properties across redshift.

Beyond academia, I enjoy badminton, board games, and spending quality time with my beloved cat, Nova.

## **Fun Facts**
- Owner of more than a dozen board games (some of them require at least an hour just to explain the rules!).
- Have survived dozens of earthquakes (I‚Äôm from Sichuan, where the frequency of earthquakes is relatively high).
- Spent 12 years learning sketching, only to realize I might not be the next Van Gogh‚Äîbut I still enjoy it!
- Watched and rated more than 1,100 movies and/or shows.
