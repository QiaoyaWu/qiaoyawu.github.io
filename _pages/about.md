Hi, I am Qiaoya Wu (吴巧雅), a first-year graduate student in the Department of Astronomy at UIUC.
My research interests are active galactic nuclei (AGNs/quasars), black hole binaries and cosmological large scale structure.
I work with Prof. Yue Shen on quasars observations and SDSS spectral analysis.
