Here in this work, we carry out a strictly simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric campaign on the prototype of black hole low-mass X-ray binary A0620-00. We find that for each observation epoch, the extra optical flux beyond a pure ellipsoidal modulation is positively correlated with the fraction of veiling emission, indicating the accretion disk contributes most of the nonellipsoidal variations. Meanwhile, we also obtain a K2V spectral classification of the companion, as well as the measurements of the companion's rotational velocity $v\sin i = 83.9\pm 1.9$ km s$^{-1}$ and the mass ratio between the companion and the black hole $q = 0.063 Â± 0.004$.
