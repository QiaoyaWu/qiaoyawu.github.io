The large scale structure (LSS) of the Universe contains plenty of cosmological information.
One of the most important task of LSS studies is to use the distribution of galaxies to interpret the initial conditions of the Universe and cosmological parameters.
To investiagate the inner relations between the early universe and current LSS, we use cosmological N-body simulation code [CUBE](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/aac830) to study the angular momentum of dark matter halos in $z=0$ and initial conditions.
