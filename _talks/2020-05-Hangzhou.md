This work based on my paper “spin mode reconstruction in Lagrangian space” published in Physical Review D in 2021.
This work was supervised by Prof. Haoran Yu in Xiamen University, and collaborated with 2 postdocs Dr. Shihong Liao and Dr. Min Du.
In this work, we defined some parameters to describe the properties of proto dark matter halos in Lagrangian space.
Then we use N-body simulations to check their influence on spin conservation and spin predictability.
The result is that, protohalos, if in a more tidal twisted environment, are more likely to generate a larger spin magnitude in Lagrangian space.
And such halos, tend to better conserve their spin directions through the cosmic evolution.
So by observing these halo-galaxy systems, we are able to know more information about the primordial universe.
Moreover, our predicted spins of such halos are more precise, which means that, giving more weights on such systems, we can directly improve the constraints of the primordial universe by spin mode reconstruction.
We plan to extend this analysis to hydrodynamical simulations like Illustris TNG.
